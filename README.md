# Predict-Tide-Level
Contains Prediction of Tide Level for COSC 6380

Goal

The purpose of this assignment is to gain experience in predicting time series data.

Description:

We will predict at 0000 and 1200 each day (midnight and noon) for 24hr in advance.   

We need to test at last three models.  These models will be different somehow (features used, hyper parameters, etc., trained on), and you will compare them against each other.
The location of the prediction will be BHP.  I've attached two files.  BHPtraining, which holds 2017-2019 data and BHPtest which holds 2020 data. 
All files are 6 minute data.  You may decide to convert it to hourly data. 

You will train on all data before January 1, 2020, and test on all data after.
